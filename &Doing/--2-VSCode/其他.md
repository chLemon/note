Go to File > Preference > Settings and choose:

Workbench â€º Tree: Indent

Controls tree indentation in pixels.

or (in your settings.json enter this directly)

"workbench.tree.indent": 10

and choose a high enough number for you.

Also see my answer at Visual Studio code sidebar Vertical guideline (customize sidebar) where with v1.36 you can add colorized tree indent guides to make the explorer file structure more obvious.

The example picture uses: "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#00ff00" in the colorCustomizations, so the guidelines will appear green.

// in settings.json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#00ff00"
}
